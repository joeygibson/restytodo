# restytodo

A sample of using [Go](https://golang.org/) to create a REST app. The code is almost entirely from
[this article](http://thenewstack.io/make-a-restful-json-api-go/). I added a suite of [Cucumber](https://cucumber.io) tests
to get better at Cucumber testing.

## Building

This command will build the app and a Docker image to run it.

    ./scripts/build

To build a runnable copy on your own platform, run

    ./scripts/buildnative

## testing

To run the Cucumber tests, run

    ./scripts/test
